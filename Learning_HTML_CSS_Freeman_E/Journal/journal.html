  <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
  <p>I've seen a couple of Burma Shave-style signs on the side of the road:</p>
  <blockquote>
    "If you don't see <br>
    cars passing by, <br>
    they might hit you. <br>
    One moment - <br>
    and infinity.." <br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I definitely didn't want to be hit by a car!</p>

  <h2>June 2, 2012:</h2>
  <img src="img/segway1.jpg" alt="The road, the mountains.. and me!">
  <p>The first day of my trip! I can't believe I was finally able to put things aside and go on my trip. Since I was
    going to ride my scooter, I couldn't take many things with me: just my..</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cell phone,</li>
    <li>iPod,</li>
    <li>digital camera,</li>
    <li>and candy bar.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would say, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step to the
      scooter</q>.
