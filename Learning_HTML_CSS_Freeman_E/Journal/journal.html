  <h1>On a scooter across the United States..</h1>
  <p>A diary of my travels on my own scooter across the United States!</p>

  <h2>20 August, 2012</h2>
  <img src="img/segway2.jpg" alt="Me and the desert!">
  <p>So, I've already driven 1,200 miles and been to several interesting places: Walla Walla, Washington, Magic City,
    Idaho, Bountiful, Utah, Last Chance, Colorado, Wye, Arizona, Trough-or-Concequence, New Mexico.</p>

  <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
  <p>I've seen a couple of Burma Shave-style signs on the side of the road:</p>
  <blockquote>"If you don't see cars passing by, they might hit you. One moment and infinity.."</blockquote>
  <p>I definitely didn't want to be hit by a car!</p>

  <h2>June 2, 2012:</h2>
  <img src="img/segway1.jpg" alt="The road, the mountains.. and me!">
  <p>The first day of my trip! I can't believe I was finally able to put things aside and go on my trip. Since I was
    going to ride my scooter, I couldn't take many things with me: just my cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and candy
    bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would say, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step to the
      scooter</q>.
